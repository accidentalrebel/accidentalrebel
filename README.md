My name is Karlo and I am currently employed as a Cyber Security Engineer where I use my development and technical skills in helping companies protect themselves from cyber threats.

Prior to this I was a professional programmer for 10+ years. I also co-founded and helped manage MindCake which developed games for 5 years.
